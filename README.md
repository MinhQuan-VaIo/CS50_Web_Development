# CS50_Web_Development
This course picks up where CS50x leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience.
The project is a webpage where teachers can create assignments for students. The implementation is fairly simple, to keep the project scope in check. I wanted to make a project like this to expand my knowledge of Node JS and of techniques like buffer piping from database to client, role based authentications, etc.

Technologies used:

- Node JS
- Express JS
- bcryptjs
- passport
- sqlite3
- ejs
- other small libraries or packages

## Possible improvements

As all applications this one can also be improved. Possible improvements:

- Have administrator account which confirms user identity, so that student could not register as a teacher
- Ability to change account details
- Have a way for teacher to upload videos to explain the assignment
- Notificaitons to email about new homeworks or submissions
